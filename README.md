From Narrative Text to Formal Action Language System Descriptions

### What is this repository for? ###

Program the system Text2DRS in Java and python.
To test my system, I will create a corpora consisting of short and interesting narratives from the bAbl Tasks Data (Facebook AI Research,. 2016) and annotate them with respective DRSes.
These narratives will be used to evaluate the quality of my system.

* System Text2DRS that takes a narrative as an input and produces a Neo-Davidsonian style DRS as an output
* Annotated corpora of bAbl narratives
