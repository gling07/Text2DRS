Soren ran through the airport, pulling her bags behind her.
The female voice above her announced final boarding to Soren's fligh.
She yelled for them to wait as she neared her gate, waving her arms.
The attendant at the desk gave Soren a sad, sympathetic look.
Nearly out of breath, Soren presented her pass and boarded the plane.
