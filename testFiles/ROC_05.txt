When I was 12 years old, my dad got angry and kicked me aggressively.
Afterward, I became very ill, and tasted something metallic.
I went to a doctor, and was informed that one of my kidneys was dead.
Ever since, I've had swelling and hypertension.
I started taking medications to combat the symptoms at 13.
